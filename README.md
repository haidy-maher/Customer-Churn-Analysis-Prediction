# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Data Mining and Predictive Modeling** project! This comprehensive notebook demonstrates an end-to-end data science pipeline applied to customer churn analysis using real-world telecom dataset.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project explores customer churn behavior by applying advanced data mining techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), association rule mining, clustering, and multiple classification models. The goal is to gain insights and build robust predictive models that accurately classify customers who are likely to churn.
